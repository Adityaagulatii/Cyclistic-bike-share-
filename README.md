### Recommendation
1) Do more promotion during Summer Season when maximum users use the app. This will also help in usage of bikes in winter season. 
2) Casual Users use bike majorly on weekends. Make weekly pass or some other promotion that helps in increasing the number of rides throughout the week. 
3) Casual Users have higher average length of ride than Member Users. Team can increase the amount on large length rides.
