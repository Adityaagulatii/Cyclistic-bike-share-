The case study is about a Bike Share Company that wants to increase its business by converting its Regular customers into Annual members. 

The report will help the company understand how normal customers and annual members use the app differently. 

Tableau has been used to do Data Visualisation.

## Conclusion 
After looking at all the findings, the conclusion is that Member users use the Cyclist app majority for the daily commute whereas Casual users use it for leisure. 

### Recommendation
1) Do more promotion during the Summer Season when the maximum number of users use the app. This will also help in the usage of bikes in the winter season. 
2) Casual Users use bikes mostly on weekends. Make a weekly pass or some other promotion that helps in increasing the number of rides throughout the week. 
3) Casual Users have a higher average length of ride than Member Users. The team can increase the amount of large-length rides.
